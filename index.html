        <p>Hi, Welcome to my Personal website. 
        I'm Mael, you probably Know me from Second Life, OSGrid or even YouthNation.
        Well here I am rebuilding my website and coding another page. It's been so difficult 
    to find the proper software to do it with since my current html coding software does not 
work with my new computer and won't be working with it for a very long time. Adobe needs some 
things to be fixed first before they actually launch it full blast onto MacOS M1 (ARM).
<br>
<br>
I would like to add somethings about friendproject since that is my primary social media at this point.
First I would like to thank the people who kept the myspace era alive all those years before it
changed into something boring and useless, however after discovering friendproject I lit up and was
happy to have found something that keeps the myspace community half alive due to it's layout and features.
If you would like an invitation to the friendproject website then you are best to see the link in
the paragraph below.
<br>
<br>
The one thing about social media is that you don't always get what you want out of it and the fact that
there will always be some crazy people trying to do some of the things you don't want them to do.
How unfortunate but there is always the block list. Just add their account name to that block list and
there goes the communication. If you feel the need to do it then you best do it. Anyway, let's get back
to what we were talking about. friendproject is a social media service designed to give people what they
need instead of pressuring people to do what they don't want to do. Rules do come with that but don't
worry, it's not any of the unfair rules that are normally put out there for selfish reasons of a business.
I really like how friendproject operates and why it's website is designed like a typical 90's website would
be. Under the hood it's totally different from html 4.01 and css but it works similar to the 90's website
layout. Now if you want that invitation after reading this paragraph here it is. Click
<a href="https://www.friendproject.net/join_me.php?r=223885">here</a> to claim the invitation at friendproject's
website.
<br>
<br>
Thanks everyone for stopping by my website and hope you have a great Day/night, which ever 
it is where you currently are.</p>
